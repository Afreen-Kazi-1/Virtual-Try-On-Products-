# Deep L-layer neural networks
  - Neural network with multiple hidden layers
  - Each layer makes a relation with the previous layer
  - Eg. For face recognition hidden layer 1 will find the edges, layer 2 will find the eyes, nose, lips, layer 3 will find the complete shape of face.

# Building blocks of deep neural networks
  - Forward and backward propagation
  - The value of Z is stored as cache for each neuron for backward propagation

---

# Hyperparameters and parameters
  - Parameters are W and B
  - Hyperparameters are: learning rate, iterations, hidden layers, hidden units, activation functions
  - Hyperparamters control parameters
