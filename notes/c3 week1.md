# Improving Model performance
  - Collect more data
  - Collect more diverse training set
  - Try regularization
  - Try dropout
  - Change network architecture
  - Train algorithm longer with gradient descent
  - Try different optimizers

---

# Orthogonalization
  - Knowing which hyperparameter to tune to achieve a certain effect
