# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## What is deep learning?
  - It is a domain of ML based on neural networks.
  - AI will transform the society as electricity did, with deep learning being a significant domain of AI.
  - Eg. Image processing, language translations, etc

## What is a neural network?
  - Neural networks are made up of neuron linked to each other. Each link has its own weight and each neuron has its own bias.
  - Each neuron also has an activation function associated with it which determines whether the neuron is relevant for the given input.

In **supervised learning**, the algorithm learns to make predictions based on labelled training data.

In **unsupervised learning**, the algorithm learns patterns in unlabelled data such as an image or audio file to predict the output.

Labelled Data: Each feature in the data has a defined meaning

Unlabelled Data:  Image, audio file
