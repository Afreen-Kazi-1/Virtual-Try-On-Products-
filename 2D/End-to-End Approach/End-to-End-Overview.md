## End-to-End Approach

A U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was used to implement an end-to-end learning model capable of "trying on" clothes directly onto a person by referring to the input segmentation mask of the person, the clothing agnostic image of the person, target clothing image, and cloth mask. The U-Net structure allows the model to focus on the fine details of both the person and the clothing while learning how to realistically superimpose the clothing over the personâ€™s body.
